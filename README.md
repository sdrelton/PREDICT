PREDICT - Pragmatic Recalibration and Evaluation of Drift In Clinical Tools

The PREDICT library provides a way to assess, and test potential repairs,
for binary prediction models that might drift over time.
Although originally designed for use in healthtech application,
the methods are applicable to any binary prediction model which might experience temporal drift.

# Examples
We have a number of examples to demonstrate common use-cases.
- Example 1 - [Basic example of tracking accuracy over time](Examples/basic_example_1_accuracy.ipynb)

# Documentation
Full documentation generated by Sphinx can be found [here.](https://sdrelton.github.io/PREDICT/)
